Mac Bootstrap
=============

The purpose of this script is to provision a new machine running a fresh install of macOS. It includes the software, dotfiles, and general preference I use for Ruby-based web development. The command line environment is based on Zsh (via [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)), Vim and Tmux running in [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/).

The [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap/blob/master/bootstrap) script is very specific to the Mac platform. It has been successfully tested on the following versions of macOS:

* El Capitan (10.11)
* Sierra (10.12)

Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure your software is up to date:

	sudo softwareupdate -i -a

Install Apple's command line tools:

	xcode-select --install

Reboot, check for additional updates, then reinstall, reboot if needed.

	sudo softwareupdate -l
	sudo softwareupdate -i -a


Installation
------------

To install with a one-liner, run this:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap/mac-mini/bootstrap && sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/bootstrap.log
```

Want to read through the script first?
```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap/mac-mini/bootstrap
less bootstrap
sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/bootstrap.log
```

WARNING: This script will ask for your admin password multiple times. You'll need to babysit it for a while. :)


What does it do?
----------------

When you invoke `bootstrap`, here's what it does:

* Check for command line tools to be installed. The script will exit if they aren't found.
* Run my adaptation of thoughtbot's [Laptop script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop). This is a provisioning script which installs lots of goodies like Homebrew, rbenv, postgres, etc. My version is now stored locally in this repo under `install/laptop`.
* Set up a [Brewfile](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle#usage), installing a variety of Homebrew packages, casks, and now [Mac App Store apps](https://github.com/argon/mas)!
* Install [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
* Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing Node.js versions.
* Clone [My Dotfiles for macOS](http://jsua.co/dotfiles) and symlink them to `$HOME`.
* ~~Set up some basic directories in `$HOME`.~~
* Install various executable scripts (for Tmux and Git) to `$HOME/bin`.
* Install Ukrainian spell-check dictionaries.
* Install [xkbswitch](https://github.com/joshukraine/xkbswitch-macosx) for displaying current language input source in Tmux status bar.
* Install several fixed-width fonts.
* Install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git) and plugins for Vim.
* Set a variety of macOS defaults. (adapted from [https://mths.be/macos](https://mths.be/macos))
* Customize the macOS dock.

NOTE: Previously, I used the `bootstrap` script to set up many of the standard directories I use in my work. But since I now have [Dropbox Pro](https://db.tt/6kiw9mn9), all those directories are downloaded automatically after Dropbox is installed. Once they've synced, I symlink them into place in `$HOME`.


Post-install Tasks
------------------

After running `bootstrap` there are still a few things that need to be done.

* Restart your machine in order for some changes to take effect.
* ~~Install software from Mac App Store.~~ (Thank you [mas-cli](https://github.com/argon/mas)!)
* Set up iTerm2 profile (see details below).
* Add personal data to `~/.gitconfig.local` and `~/.zshrc.local`.
* Set up desired macOS keyboard shortcuts (see list below)


Setting up iTerm2
----------------

Thanks to a [great blog post](http://stratus3d.com/blog/2015/02/28/sync-iterm2-profile-with-dotfiles-repository/) by Trevor Brown, I learned that you can quickly set up iTerm2 by exporting your profile. Here are the steps.

1. Open iTerm2.
2. Select iTerm2 > Preferences.
3. Under the General tab, check the box labeled "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:"
4. Press "Browse" and point it to `~/dotfiles/iterm2/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
5. Restart iTerm2.


macOS Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------------

These are my (current) primary macOS keyboard shortcuts:

* Alfred: &#8984;Space
* Spotlight search: &#8984;&#8679;Space
* Switch input source: &#8963;&#8679;Space
* Fantastical: &#8997;&#8984;Space
* OmniFocus: &#8963;&#8997;Space
* iTerm2 hotkey window: &#8997;Space
* Remap Caps Lock to CTRL (anyone know a way to automate this?)


How to personalize Mac Bootstrap for your own use.
--------------------------------------------------

No one else's development setup will ever be a perfect match for you. That said, if your needs are close enough to mine, you might benefit from using the same shell scripts and overall structure, and just swapping out the particulars with your own. Here's my recommended approach to doing that:

1) Fork this repo and clone your new fork to your local machine.

2) Review [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap/blob/master/bootstrap) and determine which sections you want to use.

* Section 1 (required): Take a look at [Laptop](https://github.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap/blob/master/install/laptop) and see what you might want to tweak. One of the biggest things is the Brewfile, which you can find in this repo under `install/Brewfile`. Here you can customize all the packages, casks, and MAS apps that will be installed. Laptop also sets up some basics that are required by the bootstrap script later on.
* Section 2 (recommended): Use `oh-my-zsh`?
* Section 3 (optional): Install NVM?
* Section 4 (required): The dotfiles. Update the `$DOTFILES_*` variables (see [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap/blob/master/bootstrap) under "Variable declarations") to reference your dotfiles. As a starting point, you can [fork mine](http://jsua.co/dotfiles) and then point to your fork.
* Section 5 (recommended): Install scripts to `~/bin`?
* Section 6 (optional): Install Ukrainian language utilities? Maybe you're interested in some [other language extensions](http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/search?f[0]=field_project_tags%3A157)?
* Section 7 (optional): Install fixed-width fonts?
* Section 8 (recommended): Use Vundle? If you prefer a different plugin manager, you can add the code for that to this section.
* Section 9 (optional): Review general macOS settings in `install/macos-defaults` and adjust as needed. `install/macos-dock` ensures that the dock contains only the apps you select. Adjust as desired. (NOTE: The `macos-dock` script depends on the `dockutil` package installed by Homebrew.)

3) Create `~/.gitconfig.local` and `~/.zshrc.local` and add in your personal information. These files are sourced in `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.zshrc` respectively.

4) Update the README with your own info, instructions/reminders so you don't forget what you did, and especially the correct install URL:

	curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-github-username>/mac-bootstrap/master/bootstrap && sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/boostrap.log

5) Run the script on your machine and wait for the first error. :) Then fix, commit, push, and repeat.
